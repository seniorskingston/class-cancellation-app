# SIMPLE FALLBACK DATA PROCEDURE

## ðŸŽ¯ What This System Does

When scraping fails or data gets corrupted, the app will automatically use your saved fallback data instead of showing empty results.

## ðŸ“‹ How to Use (Super Simple!)

### Step 1: Upload Your Excel File
1. Go to **Admin Panel**
2. Upload your `Class Cancellation App.xlsx` file
3. Wait for "âœ… Successfully uploaded" message

### Step 2: Save as Fallback
1. Click **"ðŸ’¾ Save Excel as Fallback"** button
2. Wait for "âœ… Successfully saved X programs as fallback data"
3. Done! Your Excel data is now saved as fallback

### Step 3: Save Events as Fallback (Optional)
1. If you have events loaded, click **"ðŸ’¾ Save Events as Fallback"**
2. Wait for confirmation message
3. Your events are now saved as fallback

### Step 4: Check Status (Optional)
