# Event Banner Explanation

## Current Approach
Instead of random pictures, all events now use the Seniors Kingston logo as their banner. This is much more appropriate and professional.

## Why This Approach?
1. **Professional**: Uses the official Seniors Kingston logo
2. **Consistent**: All events have the same branding
3. **Appropriate**: No random pictures that don't relate to the events
4. **Reliable**: The logo is always available and loads quickly

## Future: Real Event Banners
To get the actual event banners from the Seniors Kingston website:

1. **Manual Process**: 
   - Visit https://seniorskingston.ca/events
   - Right-click on each event banner
   - Copy the image URL
   - Update the system with real URLs

2. **Technical Challenge**: 
   - The website uses JavaScript to load content
   - Events are loaded dynamically
   - Requires manual extraction or advanced scraping
