# Manual Banner System for Seniors Kingston Events

## Current Status
The Seniors Kingston website uses JavaScript to load content dynamically, making it difficult to scrape automatically.

## Manual Process to Get Real Banners

### Step 1: Visit the Website
1. Go to https://seniorskingston.ca/events
2. Wait for the page to fully load
3. You should see event boxes with banners at the top

### Step 2: Get Banner URLs
For each event:
1. Right-click on the event banner image
2. Select "Copy image address" or "Copy image URL"
3. Note the event title

### Step 3: Update the System
1. Open the file `manual_banner_mapping.json`
2. Add the event title and banner URL
3. Run `python apply_manual_banners.py`

## Example Format
```json
{
  "Sound Escapes: Kenny & Dolly": "https://seniorskingston.ca/images/kenny-dolly-banner.jpg",
  "Wearable Tech": "https://seniorskingston.ca/images/tech-banner.jpg",
  "Legal Advice": "https://seniorskingston.ca/images/legal-banner.jpg"
}
```

## Alternative: Use Placeholder Banners
If you can't get the real banners, the current system uses appropriate placeholder banners based on event types:
- Music events: Music-themed images
- Tech events: Technology-themed images
- Legal events: Legal-themed images
- Food events: Food-themed images
- etc.

These placeholders are professional and appropriate for each event type.
