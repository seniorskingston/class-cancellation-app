# How to Get Real Seniors Kingston Event Banners

## The Problem
The current banners are random photos, not the actual event banners from the Seniors Kingston website.

## The Solution
You need to manually get the real banner URLs from the website.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Visit the Website
1. Go to https://seniorskingston.ca/events
2. Wait for the page to fully load
3. You should see event boxes with banners at the top

### Step 2: Get Banner URLs
For each event:
1. Right-click on the event banner image
2. Select "Copy image address" or "Copy image URL"
3. Note the event title

### Step 3: Update the System
1. Open the file `real_banner_mapping.json`
2. Replace the placeholder URLs with the real banner URLs
3. Save the file

### Step 4: Apply the Real Banners
Run: `python apply_real_banners.py`

## Example Format
```json
