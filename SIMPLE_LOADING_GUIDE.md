# SIMPLE EVENT LOADING SYSTEM

## 📅 How It Works:

### **When you click "Load New Events":**

1. **📥 Load Current Events**: Gets your current events
2. **🌐 Scrape Website**: Gets events from Seniors Kingston website  
3. **🔍 Compare**: Checks if each scraped event already exists
4. **➕ Add Only New**: Only adds events that don't already exist
5. **💾 Save**: Saves all events (current + new) to backend

### **Comparison Logic:**

An event is considered "the same" if it has:
- **Same name** (title)
- **Same date** (dateStr)  
- **Same time** (timeStr)

### **Example:**

#### **Your Current Events:**
- Carole's Dance Party - October 30, 1:00 pm ✅ **KEPT**
- Legal Advice - October 27, 1:00 pm ✅ **KEPT**
- Fresh Food Market - October 28, 10:00 am ✅ **KEPT**

#### **Scraped Events:**
- Carole's Dance Party - October 30, 1:00 pm ⏭️ **SKIPPED** (already exists)
- Legal Advice - October 27, 1:00 pm ⏭️ **SKIPPED** (already exists)
- New Tech Class - November 5, 2:00 pm ➕ **ADDED** (new event)
- Holiday Lunch - November 25, 12:00 pm ➕ **ADDED** (new event)

#### **Final Result:**
- Carole's Dance Party - October 30, 1:00 pm ✅ **PRESERVED**
- Legal Advice - October 27, 1:00 pm ✅ **PRESERVED**
- Fresh Food Market - October 28, 10:00 am ✅ **PRESERVED**
- New Tech Class - November 5, 2:00 pm ➕ **NEW**
- Holiday Lunch - November 25, 12:00 pm ➕ **NEW**

## ✅ **Guarantees:**

1. **No Replacement**: Existing events are never replaced
2. **No Duplicates**: Same events are not added twice
3. **Only New**: Only truly new events are added
4. **Preserve Edits**: Your edited events stay exactly as they are

## 🎯 **Answer to Your Question:**

**NO** - If a new event has the same date, name, and time as an existing event, it will **NOT** replace the old event. The old event stays exactly as it is.
